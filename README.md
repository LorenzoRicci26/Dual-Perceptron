## 🤖 Dual Perceptron Binary Classifier

This project implements a Machine Learning algorithm called Dual Perceptron, designed to perform binary classification of a target attribute based on specific features. The Dual Perceptron algorithm leverages a dual representation of data, making it effective for handling linearly separable datasets.

### 🌟 Features

Efficient binary classification using the Dual Perceptron algorithm.
Supports customization of input features and target attributes.
Designed with simplicity and clarity for educational and practical applications.

### 🔍 How It Works
The Dual Perceptron uses a dual representation of the input data and applies iterative updates to the weight vector to optimize the classification of the target attribute. This makes it highly effective for problems where the data is linearly separable.
